# Analysis of the effect of movement on Activity Detection

## Description
Fitness can take many different forms of activities and with the rise in smartphone adoption over the last decade has made it possible for people to use the onboard sensors to accuracy detect their activity. Our objective involved using sensor data on smartphones to see how the change in data collected affects the fitness activity detected. 
The data was collected from 6 participants with the sensors strapped to two positions (ankle and arm) and collected sensor data while performing four different activities (standing, walking, jogging and running) for a period of 20 seconds on a controlled environment. We ended up having 48 samples at the end of the data collection.
 
## Required Libraries

## Running the Code
1. Ensure that you have an active internet connection.
2. Open terminal
3. Navigate to the folder containing analysis .ipynb
4. Execute: "jupyter notebook"
5. Run the file by selecting it in the web interface generated.

## Output Expected
Since the file is an ipthon file all the output will be generated directly on the web interface. The plots and output can be viewed there.
